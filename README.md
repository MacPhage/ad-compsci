:notebook: Computer Science assignments

## What I use this repository for

I use it as a good place to store backups of my personal solutions to my assignments and as a good portal for tutor material. If I need to help someone solve a problem, sometimes it's handy to have the actual solution.

## What you can use this repository for

Use this however you want. For some, I've provided the instructions to the assignment in addition to the solution. This repository is primarily for the solutions, however. As this is part official Computer Science curriculum, I've found that if you know the language of one of the code snippets here, you can use it to attempt porting it to another language to make learning it better.

In my case, I was taught Java in school but wanted to learn Ruby on my own time. I started porting all the code here to Ruby to learn more about Ruby.
